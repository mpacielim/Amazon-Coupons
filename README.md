# Amazon-Coupons

This repository contains an analysis of a survey dataset that recorded information on drivers who were sent coupons for different businesses (such as bars, coffee shops and restaurants) while driving. 
The goal of the analysis was to determine whether or not the driver would accept and use the coupon.
This was completed as part of the Berkeley Professional Certificate in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence course, with the data coming from the UCI Machine Learning repository, collected via Amazon Mechanical Turk.
